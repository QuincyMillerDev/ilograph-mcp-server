# Ilograph

> Ilograph is an interactive diagramming tool for creating rich system architecture diagrams with multiple perspectives. Unlike traditional single-view diagrams, Ilograph uses a model-based approach where you define resources once and create multiple perspectives to show different relationships and interactions. It's designed for developers, architects, DevOps teams, and engineers who need to document, share, and explain complex systems.

Key features:
- **Interactive diagrams**: Click to explore, zoom, and navigate through system components
- **Multiple perspectives**: Show the same resources from different viewpoints (runtime dependencies, deployment flow, security relationships, etc.)
- **Diagrams-as-code**: Text-based markup with real-time autocomplete and live preview
- **Rich documentation**: Add detailed descriptions, walkthroughs, and markdown content
- **Multi-platform**: Available as web app, desktop application, and Confluence integration
- **Team collaboration**: Share diagrams, create workspaces, and collaborate in real-time

Ilograph excels at:
- System architecture documentation
- Onboarding new team members with interactive walkthroughs
- Aligning teams around shared understanding of systems
- Breaking down complex systems into understandable perspectives
- Maintaining up-to-date documentation with easy-to-modify diagrams
