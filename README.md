# üéØ Ilograph MCP Server

The Ilograph MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that provides AI agents with comprehensive access to Ilograph documentation, validation tools, and diagram creation guidance. Transform complex architecture documentation with intelligent assistance.

## Use Cases

- **Automated Diagram Creation**: Generate Ilograph diagrams through natural language descriptions
- **Real-time Validation**: Validate existing diagrams with detailed error analysis and suggestions
- **Documentation Access**: Get instant access to comprehensive Ilograph documentation and best practices
- **Learning & Examples**: Explore curated diagram examples with detailed explanations

> **Important**: This is an **unofficial, community-driven project** and is **not affiliated with or endorsed by Ilograph LLC**. The server provides educational and development assistance by accessing publicly available Ilograph documentation and resources.

> **Caution**: The outputs and recommendations provided by the MCP server are generated dynamically and may vary based on the query and model. Users should **thoroughly review all outputs** to ensure they align with their project requirements and **verify against official Ilograph documentation** before implementation.

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running
2. **MCP-compatible client**: Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor, etc.

## Quick Start
### Add to Your MCP Client

Add this configuration to your MCP client:

**VS Code**:

Add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P and typing Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON).

More about using MCP server tools in VS Code's agent mode documentation.
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "terraform": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run",
          "-i",
          "--rm",
          "ghcr.io/quincymillerdev/ilograph-mcp-server:latest"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Optionally, you can add a similar example (i.e. without the mcp key) to a file called .vscode/mcp.json in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "terraform": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "ghcr.io/quincymillerdev/ilograph-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop / Cursor / Jetbrains AI Assistant**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ilograph": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "ghcr.io/quincymillerdev/ilograph-mcp-server:latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it! üéâ
