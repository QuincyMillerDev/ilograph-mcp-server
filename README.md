## Use Cases

- **Automated Diagram Creation**: Generate Ilograph diagrams through natural language descriptions
- **Real-time Validation**: Validate existing diagrams with detailed error analysis and suggestions
- **Documentation Access**: Get instant access to comprehensive Ilograph documentation and best practices
- **Architecture Guidance**: Receive expert recommendations for diagram structure and icon selection
- **Learning & Examples**: Explore curated diagram examples with detailed explanations

> **Important**: This is an **unofficial, community-driven project** and is **not affiliated with or endorsed by Ilograph LLC**. The server provides educational and development assistance by accessing publicly available Ilograph documentation and resources.

> **Caution**: The outputs and recommendations provided by the MCP server are generated dynamically and may vary based on the query and model. Users should **thoroughly review all outputs** to ensure they align with their project requirements and **verify against official Ilograph documentation** before implementation.

## Prerequisites

1. **Docker**: To run the server in a container, you will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running.
2. **Python 3.11+**: For local installation (alternative to Docker)
3. **MCP-compatible client**: Such as Claude Desktop, VS Code with Copilot, or Cursor

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed and running

### Add to Your MCP Client

Add this configuration to your MCP client:

**VS Code** (Settings ‚Üí User Settings JSON or `.vscode/mcp.json`):
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "ilograph": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "ghcr.io/quincymillerdev/ilograph-mcp-server:latest"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ilograph": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "ghcr.io/quincymillerdev/ilograph-mcp-server:latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ilograph": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "ghcr.io/quincymillerdev/ilograph-mcp-server:latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

That's it! üéâ
