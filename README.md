# Ilograph MCP Server

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note (2025):** Most MCP clients (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.) currently only support MCP **tools**, not resources or prompts. This server is designed with tool-first architecture to ensure compatibility with all current MCP clients.

A FastMCP server that provides AI agents with comprehensive access to Ilograph documentation and guidance for creating accurate, valid Ilograph diagrams. The server acts as a dynamic domain expert, fetching live content from official Ilograph sources.
